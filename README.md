## hex-memory

Hello everyone! This is a game called hex-memory, where you test / improve your memory over time.

Numbers (or phrases) will flash on the screen, giving you just enough time to remember them.<br>
Then you must click the buttons in the order that was shown. Be sure to push yourself. Good luck!

## Technical Stuff Below

This project is made with [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).<br>
I used the --typescript option so we don't have to deal with ambiguity, and you can use SCSS!

Be sure to run an `npm i` after you clone the repo ❤️

## Available Scripts:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

(In VSCode, press `Ctrl + ~` to open the console)

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

This goes through your .test.tsx files, ensuring everything returns true.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
